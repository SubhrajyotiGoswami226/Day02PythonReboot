# Day 02: Tip Calculator

Welcome to **Day 02** of my **100 Days of Python Challenge**! 🚀  
This repository contains a Python script for calculating the tip and splitting the bill among friends.

## 📝 Project Description

The **Tip Calculator** is a handy tool for calculating how much each person should pay when splitting a bill. It allows the user to:
1. **Input the total number of people** sharing the bill.
2. **Enter the total bill amount**.
3. **Select a tip percentage**.

The program calculates the total amount including the tip, splits it among the given number of people, and rounds the result to two decimal places.

🎯 Purpose
This project helps to:

Practice user input and typecasting in Python.
Perform arithmetic operations, including percentages.
Round results for better readability.

🌟 Acknowledgments
Inspired by the 100 Days of Python Challenge, this project is another step towards mastering Python fundamentals.
